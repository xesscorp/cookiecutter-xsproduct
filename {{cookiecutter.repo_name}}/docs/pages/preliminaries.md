Here's some helpful information before getting started.


## Getting Help!

Here are some places to get help if you encounter problems:

* If you can't get the {{site.product_name}} to work, send us an 
   [e-mail message describing your problem](mailto:{{ site.company_help_email }}?subject=Need help with my {{site.product_name}}&body=Hi, I need some help with my {{site.product_name}}.). 
* Or [submit a problem report]({{ site.company_help_page }}).
* [Our website]({{site.company_website}}) also has
	* [example designs]({{ site.company_website }}/projects/), 
	* [application notes]({{ site.company_website }}/appnotes/), and
	* [tutorials]({{ site.company_website }}/tutorials/).
* [Our Github site]({{site.product_repo}}) contains the source
    for the {{site.product_name}} software and hardware if you really want to get into the
    nitty-gritty details.


## Take Notice!

It would be hard to get into trouble with this module.
Not to say you *couldn't*, but it's pretty much just pushbuttons.

## Packing List

Here is what you should have received in your package:

* a {{site.product_name}}.
* a male PMOD header.
* two 5&times;1 headers.
