The {{site.product_name}} provides an array of eight pushbuttons that you can insert
into an eight-bit PMOD&trade; socket (such as the ones on a [{{site.stickit_mb}}](http://www.xess.com/shop/product/stickit-mb-4_0/))
or a standard solderless breadboard.

## Inserting Your Module Into a PMOD Socket

To use the {{product_name}} with a PMOD socket, first solder the included
male PMOD header to the module as shown:

Then insert the module into a PMOD socket such as the ones on the {{site.stickit_mb}}:

## Inserting Your Module Into a Solderless Breadboard

To use the {{site.product_name}} with a solderless breadboard, first solder the two included
5&times;1 headers to the module as shown:

<img src="images/breadboard-pins.jpg" alt="{{site.product_name}} with 5&times;1 headers attached." style="width:50%;" class="center-it"/>

Then insert the module into the breadboard and make connections to it:
